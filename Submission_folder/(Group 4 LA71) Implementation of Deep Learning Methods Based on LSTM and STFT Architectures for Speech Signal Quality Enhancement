1. Description of the Project
This project focuses on addressing noise interference in speech communication systems. We implemented a Deep Learning approach using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network combined with **Digital Signal Processing (STFT/ISTFT)** techniques. The system is designed to perform **Direct Spectral Mapping**, predicting the magnitude of clean speech from noisy input signals to enhance audio clarity and intelligibility.

2. About the Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated using the **VoiceBank-DEMAND** dataset (Valentini-Botinhao, 2017).
* Content: Paired recordings of clean speech and noisy speech.
* Characteristics: Contains various environmental noise types (traffic, cafeteria, park) mixed at different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR), providing a robust testing ground for speech enhancement algorithms.

3. Methodology
The processing pipeline consists of three main stages:
1.  Pre-processing: Input audio is downsampled to 16 kHz to optimize computational efficiency. Features are extracted using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a frame length of 512 and hop length of 256.
2.  Model Architecture: A Stacked LSTM network (2 layers, 256 units each) is used to learn the temporal correlations of speech. The model performs regression to directly estimate the clean magnitude spectrogram from the noisy magnitude.
3.  Reconstruction: The enhanced waveform is reconstructed using the Inverse STFT (ISTFT). Note that the system utilizes the original noisy phase for reconstruction.

4. Analysis
The model demonstrates significant capability in suppressing background noise while preserving speech formants.

* Quantitative Results:
    * Average Input SNR: 8.51 dB
    * Average Output SNR: 14.83 dB
    * SNR Gain: +6.32 dB

* Discussion:
    While the final SNR (14.83 dB) is constrained by the **16 kHz downsampling** (limiting high-frequency resolution) and the use of **noisy phase** reconstruction, the **Gain of +6.32 dB** indicates a substantial improvement in signal quality. Visual analysis of spectrograms confirms that non-stationary noise components are effectively removed.
